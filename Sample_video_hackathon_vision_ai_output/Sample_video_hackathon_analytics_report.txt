  MEETING SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Laptops are not reaching our new hires on time for their day one. Because they
  can't access our secure environments, they sit idle, which translates to an
  immediate loss of available hours. Just looking at the data from the last two
  months, we've had 45 lateral hires join our Indian operations. Out of those, 18
  did not receive their laptops until the second week. Currently, HR only triggers
  the IT onboarding ticket after the candidates completes their final pre-joining
  background check and upload their documents to the portal. Sometimes candidates
  delay doing the doing until the very last minute. If we can integrate the HMS
  directly with our IT ticketing system, the system could automatically generate
  an asset request the moment the candidate clicks accept the offer letter.
  Puneema, could you send me the impact report on loss billing? We will use that
  data to build a quick business case. Third, I will set up a meeting for tomorrow
  with HR head. just so we have a formal SLA. I will present the business case,
  explain the proposed HRMS to IT automation and get their sign off.

  ACTION ITEMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Poornima Kumaran:
    • Purnima, since revenue office flagged this, I will hand it over to you to
      quantify the issue.
    • It's like that. It removes the manual dependency on a chart to remember to
      send an email and it gives IT the buffer they need for nationwide
      shipping. Is that integration something your team can handle, Varun?
    • Excellent. That's exactly the kind of alignment we needed today. Let me
      summarize the action items before we wrap up.
    • Second, Puneema, could you send me the impact report on loss billing? We
      will use that data to build a quick business case.
    • Third, I will set up a meeting for tomorrow with HR head. I will present
      the business case, explain the proposed HRMS to IT automation and get
      their sign off to bypass the document upload dependency.

  Varun Kumar:
    • Right now, the idea only received the asset request ticket from HR about
      three to four days before the candidates joining it.
    • Puneema, currently the process dictates that HR only triggers the IT
      onboarding ticket after the candidates completes their final pre-joining
      background check and upload their documents to the portal.

  Babuji Abraham:
    • If they have accepted the offer letter, we need to ship the machine. We
      can always remote lock the device if they end up backing out at the last
      minute.

  SPEAKER-WISE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Poornima Kumaran:
  Laptops are not reaching our new hires on time for their day one. Because they
  can't access our secure environments, they sit idle, which translates to an
  immediate loss of available hours. Poornima Kumaran said the following during
  the meeting: It's like that. It removes the manual dependency on a chart to
  remember to send an email. Babaji: Are we all aligned on these steps? Sounds
  like a solid plan, Babaji. Get their sign off to bypass the document upload
  dependency. Thanks. We solved a lot in five minutes. Have a great rest of your
  day. Thank you both for your time. Thank. you.


  Babuji Abraham:
  Babuji Abraham: "We've had 45 lateral hires join our Indian operations. Out of
  those, 18 did not receive their laptops until the second week" Abraham: If we
  calculate an average billing rate for those 18 consultants over just five
  working days, we are looking at thousands of dollars in lost revenue.


  Varun Kumar:
  Varun Kumar: Currently the process dictates that HR only triggers the IT
  onboarding ticket after the candidates completes their final pre-joining
  background check and upload their documents to the portal. If we can integrate
  the HMS directly with our IT ticketing system, the system could automatically
  generate an asset request the moment the candidate clicks accept the offer
  letter.
