Just looking at the data from the last two months, we've had 45 lateral hires join our Indian operations. Out of those, 18 did not receive their laptops until the second week. Currently, HR only triggers the IT onboarding ticket after the candidates completes their final pre-joining background check and upload their documents to the portal. Sometimes candidates delay doing the doing until the very last minute. If we can integrate the HMS directly with our IT ticketing system, the system could automatically generate an asset request the moment the candidate clicks accept the offer letter. Puneema, could you send me the impact report on loss billing? We will use that data to build a quick business case. Third, I will set up a meeting for tomorrow with HR head. just so we have a formal SLA. I will present the business case, explain the proposed HRMS to IT automation and get their sign off.",

I scheduled this quick hurdle today to address a recurring issue that is directly impacting our bottom line. As we raise continues to scale, we are seeing high volume of new joiners across India. However, we have a bottleneck. Laptops are not reaching our new hires on time for their day one. Because they can't access our secure environments, they sit idle, which translates to an immediate loss of available hours. Purnima, since revenue office flagged this, I will hand it over to you to quantify the issue. OK, that's a very valid constraint, Varun. So the root cause is in vendor supply, its internal communication. Puneema, from your visibility into the talent pipeline, offer letters are usually accepted weeks in advance. Isn't that correct? It's like that. It removes the manual dependency on a chart to remember to send an email and it gives IT the buffer they need for nationwide shipping.

Just looking at the data from the last two months, we've had 45 lateral hires join our Indian operations. Out of those, 18 did not receive their laptops until the second week. So if we calculate an average billing rate for those 18 consultants over just five working days, we are looking at thousands of dollars in lost revenue. Furthermore, it creates a terrible impression. First impression for the new joining clients that asking whether the new joinings are there. You know, we are we are forced to give or make excuses about hardware logistics. We really need a permanent fix for this. What exactly is causing this holdup on the IT hand? Exactly, that's right. But candidates usually have a 30 to a 60 day notice period and HR gets to know only a month in advance that the person is joining and where they live. Varun, why is IT only finding out three days prior? That's a flawed process. We shouldn't hold up, you know, physical hardware procurement for a final document upload. If they have accepted the offer letter, we need to ship the machine. We can always remote lock the device if they end up backing out at the last minute. The risk of the candidate posting us is much lower than the guaranteed loss of billing we are facing every week. That would be fantastic. I fully support this. It solves the billing leakage and improves the day one experience for the employee. Yes, I am fully aligned with this."

The issue is the lead time what we are being given. Right now, the idea only received the asset request ticket from HR about three to four days before the candidates joining it. Given the geographic spread of our new hires, many of whom are entire two and three cities, shipping alone takes four to five days. Before shipping, my team need at least 48 hours to image the machine, install the software and encrypt the device. We if we only get three day heads up, it is mathematically impossible to get the laptop there on time on the day of joining. Puneema, currently the process dictates that HR only triggers the IT onboarding ticket after the candidates completes their final pre-joining background check and upload their documents to the portal. Sometimes candidates delay doing the doing until the very last minute. I completely agree, Puneema. Remote locking is easy. What I need is an automated trigger. If we can integrate the HMS directly with our IT ticketing system, the system could automatically generate an asset request the moment the candidate clicks accept the offer letter. That gives my team 30-day runway. We can configure it and ship it early and just keep the account credentials locked until the day one. Yes, Babaji. We can standard APIs for both the HRMS and IT service desk if HR gives us the green light to alter the workflow. My team can build and test the automation by next Friday."
